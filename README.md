## Hi there, I'm Roenan! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I'm a passionate 2nd-year software engineering student at the University of Arizona, with a strong enthusiasm for programming and technology. My journey in software development began with my fascination for creating projects that solve real-world problems. As a lifelong learner, I'm always seeking opportunities to enhance my programming skills and expand my knowledge in various domains.

### Education
- Pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at the University of Arizona.
- Minoring in Systems Engineering to gain a holistic understanding of complex systems and their interactions.

### Professional Experience
During the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to work as an intern where I developed a compressor tester, gaining valuable hands-on experience in hardware-software integration and testing procedures. Currently, I'm an engineering intern at Air Lift, actively involved in coding projects that challenge and enrich my understanding of software development.

### Tech Stack
I'm proficient in Python and Arduino programming, and I've recently expanded my skills to include C and C++. I'm also well-versed in UML object-oriented design and have experience working with Xcode. I'm currently setting up to design a small-scale iOS-based weather app, where I'll be applying my knowledge of iOS development and further honing my skills.

### Projects
- [Compressor Tester](https://github.com/Roenan-b/Compressor-Tester): Tests the Air Lift Compressors for failures
- [Go Fish](https://github.com/Roenan-b/Modified-Go-Fish-Game): Modified version of the classic card game "Go Fish"


### Current Focus
I'm dedicated to advancing my skills as a programmer and gaining hands-on experience in various programming languages and technologies. My current focus is on designing and developing the iOS weather app, where I'm excited to apply my newfound knowledge and skills.
