## Hi there, I'm Roenan! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I'm a passionate 3rd-year software engineering student at the University of Arizona, with a strong enthusiasm for programming and technology. My journey in software development began with my fascination for creating projects that solve real-world problems. As a lifelong learner, I'm always seeking opportunities to enhance my programming skills and expand my knowledge in various domains.

### Education
- Pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at the University of Arizona.

### Professional Experience
I completed an internship with Air Lift in the summer of 2023, where I developed a compressor tester, gaining valuable hands-on experience in hardware-software integration and testing procedures. I returned to Air Lift in the summer of 2024 to work on the software for a new project called Smart Hitch, which is set to be released soon.

### Tech Stack
Iâ€™m proficient in C, C++, Python, and Arduino programming. Recently, I've been expanding my skills in web development, learning React, and using Next.js as a framework. I also have experience in UML object-oriented design and have dabbled in iOS development. Iâ€™ve recently pushed the first version of my new website, The Soil Watch, which monitors soil moisture for plant care.
